Go SDK for [AI Agent Assembly](https://github.com/ai-agent-assembly) — runtime governance for AI agent tool calls.

The SDK initialises in a few lines, propagates agent identity through `context.Context`, wraps your agent's tool slice with policy enforcement, and forwards every check + result to the AAASM gateway over gRPC or HTTP.

## Project status

`go-sdk` is **pre-release** — see the [releases page](https://github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk/releases) (or the **release** badge above) for the current published tag. The [`VERSION`](VERSION) file pins the gateway **protocol version** the SDK is built against (currently `0.0.1-rc.6`). The public `assembly` package API may still change between pre-release tags — pin an exact tag in your `go.mod` and review the [release notes](https://github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk/releases) before upgrading. See [Core-runtime compatibility](docs/compatibility.md) for the version/protocol contract.

Anything outside the `assembly/` package (`internal/`, `examples/`) is not part of the public API and may change without notice.

## Framework compatibility

The first-class agent-framework adapter is **[LangChainGo](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo)** (`github.com/tmc/langchaingo`), tested on the **`v0.1.x`** line (CI and the [`agent-assembly-examples/go/langchaingo`](https://github.com/ai-agent-assembly/examples/tree/master/go/langchaingo) sample pin `v0.1.14`). `assembly.WrapChain` governs a LangChainGo `chains.Chain`; `assembly.WrapTools` governs any tool.

The SDK requires **no framework by default** — `go.mod` imports neither `langchaingo` nor any other framework. `assembly.Tool` is structurally identical to LangChainGo's `tools.Tool` (`Name`/`Description`/`Call`), so `WrapTools` governs an arbitrary slice of `langchaingo/tools.Tool` values (or any other type with the same three methods) with no adapter. Go-side coverage is LangChainGo plus this generic tool-wrapping — there are no other per-framework adapters.

Go framework compatibility is documented authoritatively in [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md#framework-compatibility) — the LangChainGo adapter and `WrapTools` live in this SDK. The core docs provide a cross-SDK **index/hub** that links to this page and the Python/Node equivalents at **<https://docs.agent-assembly.com/core/stable/reference/framework-compatibility.html>** (a `/stable/` link that 404s until GA by design).

## Prerequisites

- **Go ≥ 1.26** — the floor declared in `go.mod`.
  - **Security — build with Go ≥ 1.26.5.** [GO-2026-5856](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5856) is a `crypto/tls` Encrypted-Client-Hello (ECH) privacy leak in the Go **standard library**, fixed in go1.26.5. Because the vulnerable code lives in the stdlib, the fix ships with *your* compiler, not this module — the module deliberately keeps a broad `go 1.26.0` floor (and pins `toolchain go1.26.5` for its own build and `govulncheck` gate), so a consumer compiling go-sdk with Go 1.26.0–1.26.4 still links the vulnerable stdlib. Security-conscious builds should use Go ≥ 1.26.5 to pick up the fix.
- For production: an operator-issued gateway URL and API key. For local development you can skip both — `Init` discovers a gateway on `http://localhost:7391` (see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md#gateway-and-credential-resolution)).
- *(Optional)* a C compiler — only needed if you build with `-tags aa_ffi_go` to enable the native FFI transport. The default transport is pure-Go and runs cleanly with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk

### Supply-chain verification

The **only** canonical module is:

```text
github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk
```

Anything else (a different owner, a typosquat, or a vendored copy you did not pull yourself) is **not** us. Verify what you actually pulled:

- **Checksum DB** — `go get` and `go mod download` authenticate every module version against the public Go checksum database (`sum.golang.org`) and record the hashes in `go.sum`. A mismatch fails the build, so a tampered or substituted module cannot install silently.
- **Re-verify on demand** — run `go mod verify` to confirm the modules in your local cache still match `go.sum`. To force a clean re-fetch and re-check against the checksum DB, clear the cache (`go clean -modcache`) then `go mod download github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk`. Keep the default checksum settings (do not set `GOFLAGS=-insecure` or add the module to `GONOSUMDB`/`GOPRIVATE`), which would disable this check.
- **SBOM** — every release tag attaches a CycloneDX SBOM (`sbom.cdx.json`) to its [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk/releases), generated by the tag-triggered release workflow. Cross-check it against your advisory feed to audit the dependency set.
- **Release gate** — a release tag only publishes after `go mod verify` + `govulncheck` pass in CI, so a release cannot ship on a known-vuln dependency.

## Quick Start

> [!WARNING]
> **Agent registration is not reachable from a plain `go get` today — following this quick start will not make your agent appear in the dashboard.** The `Init` call below wraps and governs tool calls, but the register handshake runs *only* under the opt-in native cgo binding (`-tags aa_ffi_go`, `CGO_ENABLED=1`), and that native library (`libaa_ffi_go`) is **not published anywhere** yet. The default pure-Go build has no native transport, so it does not register even when `WithSidecarAddress` is set. See [docs/quick-start.md](docs/quick-start.md) for the full explanation; track status in [AAASM-4547](https://lightning-dust-mite.atlassian.net/browse/AAASM-4547) and [AAASM-4469](https://lightning-dust-mite.atlassian.net/browse/AAASM-4469).

```go
import (
    "context"
    "log"

    "github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk/assembly"
)

ctx := assembly.WithAgentID(context.Background(), "my-agent")
a, err := assembly.Init(ctx, assembly.WithGatewayURL(url), assembly.WithAPIKey(key))
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer a.Close()
```

`WithAgentID` attaches the calling agent's identity to `ctx`; the SDK forwards it (and any `WithTraceID` / `WithRunID` values) to the gateway on every `Check` and `RecordResult`. See [Context Propagation](#context-propagation) below for the full set of context helpers.

Then wrap your agent's tools so every call is governed:

```go
governed := assembly.WrapTools(myTools, nil)
```

The second argument is the `GovernanceClient` that talks to the gateway; passing `nil` gives a passthrough wrapper (tools run, no gateway calls) — wire in a real client when you're ready to enforce. Each call against a tool in `governed` is then checked against the gateway policy before it runs and recorded after. Hand `governed` to your agent in place of the originals. See [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md) for the end-to-end walk-through.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor workflow, including the optional CGo native FFI build (`-tags aa_ffi_go`) and the memory regression harness.

## Context Propagation

- `assembly.WithAgentID` / `assembly.AgentIDFromContext` propagate and read agent identity.
- `assembly.WithTraceID` / `assembly.TraceIDFromContext` propagate explicit trace IDs and fallback to OpenTelemetry span context trace ID when unset.
- `assembly.WithRunID` / `assembly.RunIDFromContext` propagate run identity.
- `assembly.EnsureRunID` guarantees a stable run ID within the same context tree.

## Gateway Context Handling

- `GatewayClient.Check` fails fast when `ctx` is already cancelled.
- If `ctx` has no deadline, `GatewayClient.Check` applies SDK timeout defaults (`500ms` unless overridden by `WithTimeout`).
- The final effective context (values + timeout/deadline) is passed to the gateway transport check call.

## FFI Transport

- CGo bridge module lives in `internal/ffi/cgo_bridge.go` with `#cgo LDFLAGS: -laa_ffi_go`.
- Native FFI path is enabled with build tags: `-tags aa_ffi_go` (and `CGO_ENABLED=1`).
- Pure-Go UDS fallback is selected automatically when `aa_ffi_go` tag is not set.
- `CGO_ENABLED=0` is explicitly supported via fallback transport and CI matrix coverage.
- Optional memory harness test (1M sends): `AAASM_MEMORY_HARNESS=1 go test ./internal/ffi -run TestMemoryRegressionHarness`.
