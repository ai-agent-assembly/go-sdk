# go-sdk · AI Agent Assembly

AI agents take real actions — calling APIs, running code, spending money, touching
data. This SDK lets a team decide, in advance, which of those actions an agent is
allowed to take, and keeps a record of every one. It is the Go on-ramp to that
control.

The **Go SDK for AI Agent Assembly** lets you put a governance checkpoint in
front of the tools your AI agent calls — without rewriting the agent. You
initialise the runtime once, wrap your tool slice, and from then on every tool
call is checked against your gateway's policy *before* it runs and recorded
*after* it finishes.

It is written in idiomatic Go: functional options, context-first APIs, typed
errors, and a pure-Go default that builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.

## What it is

Concretely, the SDK is two things working together:

- **A thin governance client.** It opens one connection to the AI Agent
  Assembly **gateway** (the policy brain, which lives in the
  [agent-assembly](https://github.com/ai-agent-assembly/agent-assembly) core
  repo) and speaks its wire protocol over gRPC/HTTP — or, in local
  development, auto-discovers and starts a gateway for you.
- **An in-process interception shim.** `WrapTools` decorates your existing
  `Tool` values so each `Call` runs a policy `Check` first and a
  `RecordResult` after. Your agent code keeps calling tools the way it always
  did; the wrapper does the governance.

For the platform as a whole — what the gateway is, how policy and budgets are
authored, and how the three interception layers fit together — see the
[core agent-assembly documentation](https://ai-agent-assembly.github.io/agent-assembly/)
and the shared [docs hub](https://ai-agent-assembly.github.io/agent-assembly-docs/).

## Who it's for

- **Go developers** building or operating AI agents who need allow/deny, audit,
  budget, and topology governance over what their agents can do — and want to
  add it as a library, not a rewrite.
- **Platform teams** standardising agent governance across services: the same
  gateway and policy back several languages (there are sibling
  [Python](https://ai-agent-assembly.github.io/python-sdk/) and
  [Node](https://ai-agent-assembly.github.io/node-sdk/) SDKs), so a Go service
  joins the same control plane.

## Quick look

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"

    "github.com/ai-agent-assembly/go-sdk/assembly"
)

func main() {
    ctx := assembly.WithAgentID(context.Background(), "my-agent")

    a, err := assembly.Init(ctx,
        assembly.WithGatewayURL("https://gateway.example.com"),
        assembly.WithAPIKey("..."), // optional for local dev
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer a.Close()

    governed := assembly.WrapTools(myTools, nil)
    _ = governed // hand these to your agent in place of the originals
}
```
